# Act 1: Rescue Sparkle!

*Estimated Time: 30-40 minutes*

## Scene 1: The Village Square

You are all in the village square on a sunny morning. Suddenly, you hear crying! Old Farmer Brown runs up to you. 'Please help!' he says. 'My friend Sparkle, a baby dragon, is trapped in the old windmill! Can you heroes save her?'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Starting the Adventure**  This is a straightforward hook. Let each player introduce their character! Ask: 'What does your hero look like?' and 'Why do you want to help?'  **If they ask about Sparkle:** She's a baby dragon - smaller than a dog, purple and pink scales, very friendly and loves flowers.  **If they ask why she's trapped:** Some mean goblins locked her in there yesterday!  **Once they agree to help:** Farmer Brown gives them a small bag with 3 healing potions (heals 1d6 HP each) and points toward the old windmill on the hill. |

## Scene 2: The Path to the Mill

You walk along a dirt path toward the old windmill. The path is lined with colorful flowers. As you get closer, you hear a sad little roar from inside the mill. Suddenly, three goblins jump out from behind a bush! They look mean and are carrying clubs!

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: First Combat!**  This is their first fight! Make it exciting but not too scary.  **Goblin Stats:** HP 5, Attack needs 10+, Damage 1d4. There are 3 goblins.  **If players want to talk instead of fight:** Great! The goblins say 'We work for King Grumbletooth! He said to guard this mill!' If players offer something nice (food, shiny things), the goblins might leave peacefully (DC 12 persuasion).  **Combat tips:** Describe their attacks vividly! 'The goblin swings its club at you!' Let kids use creative tactics - if they want to trip a goblin, let it work!  **If fight goes badly:** One goblin gets scared and runs away. The others follow! |

## Scene 3: Inside the Windmill - Ground Floor

You push open the creaky mill door. Inside, it's dusty and dark. Old sacks of grain are piled everywhere. You hear Sparkle crying from upstairs: 'Help! I'm stuck!' You also notice a locked wooden door on the far wall.

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Exploration and Choices**  Let players explore! Here's what they can find:  **If they search the grain sacks (DC 10):** They find a shiny silver key! This opens the locked door.  **If they try the locked door:** Need the key, OR a Rogue can pick the lock (DC 12), OR they can break it down together with strength (DC 15, everyone can help).  **Behind the locked door:** A small storage room with a rope, a lantern, and a wooden shield (+1 to defense for whoever takes it).  **The stairs to the second floor:** Are in the corner, slightly hidden. DC 8 to notice them (automatic for anyone who says they're looking for Sparkle).  **Don't rush them!** Let them look around and find things. Reward creativity! |

## Scene 4: The Giant Spider!

As you climb the stairs, you see a HUGE spider web blocking the way! And in the middle of the web... is a giant spider! It's as big as a cat and has eight glowing eyes. It hisses at you!

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: The Spider Encounter**  **Giant Spider Stats:** HP 8, Attack needs 11+, Damage 1d6  **Creative Solutions:**  • If they have the lantern: Can use fire to scare it away (automatic)  • If Druid talks to it: Spider is actually scared of goblins! Wants to leave. Will let them pass.  • Cut through web: DC 10 to carefully cut without alerting spider  • Offer food: If they have any food, spider takes it and leaves  **If they fight:** Spider attacks but isn't very tough. After taking 4 damage, it runs away.  **Reward creativity heavily here!** This teaches them there are always multiple solutions. |

## Scene 5: Rescuing Sparkle!

You reach the top floor of the mill! There, in a wooden cage, is Sparkle the baby dragon! She's purple and pink with shimmering scales. She looks at you with big, hopeful eyes. 'You came to save me!' she squeaks. 'Please get me out!' The cage has a big lock on it.

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Freeing Sparkle**  Ways to free her:  **• Rogue picks lock: DC 10**  **• Break cage bars: DC 13 (Barbarians get advantage)**  **• Look for key: DC 12 search finds it hidden under hay**  **• Magic solutions: Wizard can use Mage Hand to get key from inside cage**  **When freed:** Sparkle jumps out and does a happy little flip! She nuzzles each hero. 'Thank you! Thank you! But... something's wrong with the forest. All the magic is fading! We need the Rainbow Gems to bring it back! King Grumbletooth stole them!'  **IMPORTANT:** Sparkle stays with the party for the rest of the adventure! She can't fight, but she's helpful and encouraging. Use her to give hints if players get stuck. She has a cute voice!  **Reward:** Everyone gets +1 to their next roll because they feel so proud! |

**End of Act 1**

The party has rescued Sparkle! They now know they must find the Rainbow Gems. This is a great time for a 5-minute break!

# Act 2: The Rainbow Gems Quest

*Estimated Time: 40-50 minutes*

## Scene 6: Into the Whispering Woods

Sparkle leads you into the Whispering Woods. The trees here are magical - their leaves shimmer with all the colors of the rainbow! But as you walk deeper, you notice the colors are fading. 'This is because of the stolen gems,' Sparkle explains sadly. 'We need to find all three Rainbow Gems: the Ruby of Fire, the Sapphire of Water, and the Emerald of Earth.'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Act 2 Structure**  This act has three mini-quests, one for each gem. Players can do them in any order! Let them choose which path to take first.  Present them with three paths:  1. Left path - leads to the Singing Stream (Sapphire)  2. Middle path - leads to the Crystal Cave (Emerald)  3. Right path - leads to the Sunset Grove (Ruby)  Each gem takes about 10-15 minutes. You'll guide them back to this fork after each gem. |

## Gem Quest 1: The Sapphire of Water

### Location: The Singing Stream

You follow the left path to a beautiful stream. The water makes a musical sound as it flows! Sitting on a rock in the middle of the stream is a friendly water spirit. She looks like a girl made of water, and she's crying. 'My Sapphire gem is stuck at the bottom of the deep pool!' she says. 'I'm too scared to dive down there - there might be fish that bite!'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: The Sapphire Quest**  The Challenge: Get the Sapphire from the bottom of a 10-foot deep pool.  **Solutions:**  • Dive for it: DC 10 swimming check. Success = they get the gem!  • Use rope: If they have rope, can tie it around their waist and friends pull them back up (automatic success!)  • Wizard Mage Hand: Can float the gem up! (automatic success)  • Drain the pool: If they find a creative way to redirect water (DC 12), pool becomes shallow  • Talk to fish: Druid or Half-Elf can befriend the fish! Fish bring up the gem (automatic)  **The fish aren't actually mean!** If they go down, describe colorful friendly fish that swim around them curiously.  **Reward:** The water spirit is so happy! She gives each hero a water breathing bubble (one-time use: can breathe underwater for 10 minutes). The Sapphire glows blue and warm! |

## Gem Quest 2: The Emerald of Earth

### Location: The Crystal Cave

The middle path leads you to a cave entrance. Beautiful crystals grow on the walls, sparkling in the light! As you enter, you see small tunnels branching off in different directions. In the main chamber, there's a large boulder with the Emerald embedded in it! But wait... the boulder starts to shake! It's not a boulder - it's a Rock Elemental! It sits up and speaks in a deep, rumbly voice: 'Why do you disturb my sleep?'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: The Emerald Quest**  The Rock Elemental isn't evil! It's just grumpy because it was sleeping. It can be reasoned with!  **Rock Elemental Stats (if they fight):** HP 12, Attack needs 12+, Damage 1d8  **Better Solutions:**  • Explain situation: DC 10 persuasion. If they explain about the fading magic, it understands!  • Offer treasure: If they offer something shiny, it trades the Emerald  • Make it comfortable: If they offer to bring it pillows or soft moss, it's happy to help!  • Sing a lullaby: DC 10 performance check. It goes back to sleep and they can take the gem  **Cave exploration:** If they explore side tunnels before talking to elemental, they find pretty crystals worth 10 gold pieces each (these can be used as gifts later).  **Reward:** If they're nice to the Elemental, it becomes their friend! It gives each hero a crystal that glows in the dark. The Emerald pulses with green light! |

## Gem Quest 3: The Ruby of Fire

### Location: Sunset Grove

The right path takes you to a grove where the trees have golden-red leaves. In the center of the grove is a small volcano that bubbles with warm (not hot!) lava. A phoenix bird - bright orange and red - circles overhead. It lands near you. 'Greetings, young heroes!' it says in a kind voice. 'The Ruby of Fire rests at the top of this volcano. But beware - my mischievous friend, the Fire Salamander, guards it. He loves games and riddles!'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: The Ruby Quest**  This is a puzzle/game encounter, not combat!  **The Fire Salamander:** A small, bright orange lizard made of flames (but not burning!). It's playful and giggly.  **The Challenge:** The Salamander will give them the Ruby if they can win at one of its games:  **Game 1 - Riddle Me This:**  Riddle: 'I can fly without wings. I can cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?'  Answer: A cloud! (Accept any reasonable answer from kids)  **Game 2 - Hide and Seek:**  Salamander hides in the grove. DC 12 perception to find it (hidden in a glowing bush).  **Game 3 - Dance Contest:**  DC 10 performance. Describe the silly dance they do! Salamander judges.  **Let kids choose which game!** If they fail, Salamander gives them another chance or an easier challenge.  **Reward:** Salamander happily gives them the Ruby! Phoenix is proud of them and gives each hero a feather that keeps them warm forever. The Ruby glows with red fire! |

**When All Gems Are Collected**

As soon as you collect the last gem, all three gems start to glow! Red, blue, and green light swirl together. Sparkle jumps up excitedly! 'You did it! You got all the Rainbow Gems! Now we just need to stop King Grumbletooth. He's hiding in his fort on the hill. Let's go teach that grumpy goblin a lesson!'

**End of Act 2**

The party has all three gems! Time for a 10-minute break before the final confrontation!

# Act 3: Defeat King Grumbletooth!

*Estimated Time: 30-40 minutes*

## Scene 7: The Goblin Fort

You arrive at a small wooden fort on top of a hill. It has walls made of logs and a big wooden gate. You can hear goblins inside, laughing and playing around. There's a sign that says 'GRUMBLETOOTH'S FORT - NO HEROES ALLOWED!' Sparkle whispers, 'We need to get inside somehow!'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Getting Inside the Fort**  Let players come up with creative solutions! Here are some options:  **• Knock on the door:** A goblin guard peeks through. If they pretend to be pizza delivery or have a clever disguise (DC 10), he opens the gate!  **• Climb the walls:** DC 12 athletics check. Success = they get over the wall quietly  **• Find secret entrance:** DC 13 investigation. There's a small tunnel under the wall (perfect for small heroes!)  **• Wizard magic:** Sleep spell can make gate guards sleep, or they float everyone over with magic  **• Distraction:** Make loud noises on one side while others sneak in the other side  There are 3 goblin guards (HP 5 each) if they fight their way in. But try to encourage sneaky/creative solutions! |

## Scene 8: Inside the Fort

Once you're inside the fort, you see a courtyard with several goblins running around. In the center is a big throne made of sticks and stones. Sitting on the throne is King Grumbletooth! He's bigger than the other goblins, wears a crown made of twigs, and has a very grumpy face. He's holding a scepter with a fake gem on top. When he sees you, he stands up angrily. 'Who dares enter MY fort?!' he shouts.

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: Confronting Grumbletooth**  This is the big moment! Make Grumbletooth funny but not too scary. He's more silly than evil.  **Grumbletooth's personality:** He's like a grumpy kid having a tantrum. He wanted to be important and powerful, so he stole the gems and trapped Sparkle. But he doesn't really understand magic.  **Non-combat solutions (encourage these!):**  • Talk it out: DC 12 persuasion. 'Why did you steal the gems?' He admits he was lonely and wanted attention  • Offer friendship: If they invite him to be friends instead of a villain, he might agree (DC 10)  • Trade: Offer him something better than the fake gems - the crystals from the cave, or make him a real crown  • Make him laugh: Tell jokes or do funny things. DC 10 performance. If he laughs, he softens  **If they must fight:**  King Grumbletooth: HP 15, Attack needs 12+, Damage 1d8  4 Goblin Guards: HP 5 each, Attack needs 10+, Damage 1d4  **Combat tip:** After Grumbletooth takes 7 damage, he starts to cry and gives up. The other goblins stop fighting too. |

## Scene 9: The Resolution

After you defeat or convince King Grumbletooth, he sits down on his throne and sighs. 'I just wanted to be special,' he says sadly. 'Nobody ever wants to play with me or be my friend. So I thought if I had magic gems, people would think I was important.' Sparkle looks at him with kind eyes. 'Being mean isn't the way to make friends, Grumbletooth. But maybe... we could help you find a better way?'

|  |
| --- |
| **DM GUIDANCE: The Redemption Scene**  This is a teaching moment! Let the players decide what to do with Grumbletooth.  **If they're kind to him:** He becomes their friend! He says he'll help protect the forest instead of causing trouble. His goblins cheer - they're happy their king is nice now!  **If they're mean to him:** Gently guide them toward kindness. Have Sparkle say, 'Remember, even grumpy people deserve a second chance!' Let them reconsider.  **The Ending:** Once things are resolved, it's time to return the gems and restore the magic! |

## Scene 10: The Magic Returns!

You return to the Whispering Woods with the three Rainbow Gems. Sparkle asks you to place them on an ancient stone pedestal in the center of the forest. When you do, the gems start to glow brighter and brighter! Red, blue, and green light shoot up into the sky like fireworks! The trees start to shimmer with color again! Flowers bloom! The stream sings louder! Magic sparkles fill the air! You did it - you saved the forest!

All the creatures of the forest come out to celebrate! The water spirit, the Rock Elemental, the Phoenix, and the Fire Salamander all cheer for you! Even King Grumbletooth and his goblins come to the party! Sparkle gives each of you a special hug with her wings. 'Thank you, heroes!' she says. 'You saved me, saved the forest, and even helped Grumbletooth learn to be kind. You are TRUE heroes!'
